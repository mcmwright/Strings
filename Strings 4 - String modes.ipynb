    "## Overview\n",
    "In the last notebook we used d'Alembert's solution of the one-dimensional wave equation to predict the motion of a plucked string. The result wasn't a perfect simulation of a real string because of the modelling assumptions that we made in order to make the problem simple enough to solve, which we can classify into:\n",
    "- Wave equation assumptions (no stiffness, planar, small amplitude).\n",
    "- Boundary conditions assumptions (rigidly fixed ends).\n",
    "- Initial condition assumptions (stationary triangular shape).\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the model was a deliberate simplification its predictions of the string's motion were good, at least for the first few periods. We were also able to predict the time-history of the force signal applied to the bridge. As noted it's unrealistic that this signal doesn't decay but there's another question that's of interest to Acoustical engineers: what does it sound like? What is its frequency content? We'll explore that question in this notebook."
